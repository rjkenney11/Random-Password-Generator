## Random Password Generator
The objective of this homework was to create a password generator that would randomly make a string of characters that could include uppercase/lowercase letters, special characters and numbers based on the users selections or preferences.


## Motivation
A real world application where this could be utilized could be during the creation of a profile in a website where a random temporary password is assigned to a new user.
